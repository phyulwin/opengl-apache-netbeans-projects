# OpenGL-Apache-NetBeans
## Computer Graphics

Projects exploring **2D and 3D computer graphics** using OpenGL and C++. Covered both theory and implementation, from geometric transformations to rendering and animation.

**Key Topics:**

* 2D & 3D drawing techniques
* Graphics pipeline & rendering hardware
* Geometric transformations (translate, rotate, scale)
* Clipping, projection, and color models (RGB, CMY, HSV)
* 3D modeling, shaders, and basic animation

**Tools:** C++, OpenGL (GLUT/GLEW), Apache NetBeans, GLM

**Skills Gained:**

* Implementing the graphics pipeline in OpenGL
* Drawing & manipulating 3D objects
* Writing shaders & managing vertex buffers
* Applying transformations & projections in code
* Adding animation & interactivity to scenes
